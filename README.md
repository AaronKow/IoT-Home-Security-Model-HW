#Source Code Repository for IoT Home Security Model Hardwares

###IoT Home Security Model
######A model of home security system that utilized sensors and internet to monitor the security status in real-time.

The hardwares (microcontroller) used in this project are Arduino Yun and Arduino Mega 2560. 
In this repository contains two important folders, IoTHome-Yun and IoTHome-Mega. Each folder contains Arduino Sketch .ino which one for Arduino Yun and another for Arduino Mega 2560.
Please add Modified-DHT-sensor-library to your Arduino IDE. The DHT library is customized for this project.
If there is any issue or question about the codes, you can open issue or leave a message to me.
